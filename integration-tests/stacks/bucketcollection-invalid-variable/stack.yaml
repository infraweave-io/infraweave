        # Minimal example

        This is a deployment stack consisting of a two S3-buckets.

        These are for testing dependencies between modules.
        You will see that bucket2 will get its name based on the name of bucket1a, with appended '-after' at the end.

        ### bucket1a
        This module creates an S3 bucket.

        ### bucket2
        This module creates an S3 bucket that depends on bucket1a.
        
        It also shows how to use tags with dependencies.
      variables:
        bucket1a:
          bucketName: bucket1a-name
        bucket2:
          tags:
            SomeTag: SomeValue
            AnotherTag: "ARN of dependency bucket {{ S3Bucket::bucket1a::bucketArn }}"
