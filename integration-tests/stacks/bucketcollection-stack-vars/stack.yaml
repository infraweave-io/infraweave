    This is a deployment stack consisting of two S3-buckets demonstrating stack-level variables.
    
    ## Details
    Both buckets use a stack-level variable 'environment' to construct their names.
    This allows setting a single value that's used across multiple modules in the stack.

  stackVariableDefinitions:
    - name: environment
      description: Environment name used to prefix bucket names

        # Stack variables example

        This demonstrates using stack-level variables across multiple modules.
        The 'environment' variable is set once at the stack level and used by both buckets.
      variables:
        stack:
          environment: production
