# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to create a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone. Our goal is to foster an open and diverse community, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating respect and empathy toward all participants.
- Providing constructive feedback and gracefully accepting it.
- Using inclusive and welcoming language.
- Being mindful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Discrimination or offensive comments based on personal characteristics.
- Trolling, intentional disruption, or derailing discussions.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit consent.
- Other conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to enforce these standards consistently and fairly. Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They also reserve the right to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces where individuals represent the project or its community. Examples include interactions in issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, social media, or any project-related events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [opensource@infraweave.com](mailto:opensource@infraweave.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter and the reported incident.

Project maintainers who fail to enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other project members.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
